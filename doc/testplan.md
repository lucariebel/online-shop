# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This test plan describes the testing strategy for the *WebShop24* project. It defines the types of tests, test coverage, tools, and procedures to ensure quality.

## 1.2 Scope

The test plan covers the tests of the **Frontend** (Angular), the **Backend** (ASP.NET), and the **REST APIs**.  
The following types of tests are included:
- Unit Tests
- API Tests (Integration Tests)

Excluded from coverage:
- Load and Performance Tests
- UI/End-to-End Tests

## 1.3 Intended Audience

This test plan is intended for the developers and testers of the project, as well as project documentation supervisors.

# 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

## 2.1 Evaluation Mission

The goal is to detect errors early, ensure correct functionality, and prevent critical defects that could affect user experience.

## 2.2 Test Motivators

- Ensure core functionality (displaying products, creating auctions, placing bids).
- Minimize technical risks (APIs working correctly, services communicating reliably).
- Meet project requirements within limited time and resources.

---

# 3. Target Test Items

- Angular Frontend components (services, pipes, logic).
- ASP.NET Backend components (controllers, services, models).
- RESTful APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints).

---

# 4. Outline of Planned Tests

## 4.1 Test Inclusions

- **Frontend:**
  - Unit tests with Jasmine and Karma.

- **Backend:**
  - Unit tests with NUnit.
  - API tests with **Swagger** (manual).

## 4.2 Test Exclusions

- No load, performance, or UI tests.

---

# 5. Test Approach

## 5.1 Testing Techniques and Types

### 5.1.1 Unit Testing

- **Frontend:** Jasmine/Karma unit tests for individual components, services, and pipes.
- **Backend:** NUnit tests for methods and classes.

### 5.1.2 Integration Testing (API Tests)

- Testing REST API endpoints using **Swagger** (manual).
- Verifying correct status codes, response times, and contents.

---

# 6. Entry and Exit Criteria

## 6.1 Entry Criteria

- All necessary features are implemented and deployable.
- Local testing possible.

## 6.2 Exit Criteria

- 20–30% test coverage in frontend and backend achieved.
- All critical unit and API tests pass without errors.

---

# 7. Deliverables

- **Test Reports:**
  - Jasmine/Karma reports for frontend tests.
  - NUnit reports for backend tests.
  - Swagger (manual verification of API endpoints).

- **Test Coverage Reports:**
  - Frontend: Automatically generated by Karma/Jasmine Coverage.
  - Backend: Automatically generated by NUnit and Coverage tools.

- **Bug Documentation:**
  - Issues documented in the repository (Git).

---

# 8. Testing Workflow

- Developers write unit tests alongside feature development.
- Tests are executed locally on developer PCs (VS Code, Visual Studio).
- Tests are run manually before each commit.
- Weekly review of test status.
- No automated CI/CD testing (manual local execution only).

---

# 9. Environmental Needs

- **Frontend Testing Environment:**
  - Node.js + Angular CLI
  - Jasmine and Karma

- **Backend Testing Environment:**
  - .NET 7 or higher
  - NUnit, Swagger

- **Hardware:**
  - Local developer machines

---

# 10. Responsibilities, Staffing, and Training Needs

- **Test Responsible:** Luca Riebel
- **Test Case Maintenance:** Each developer maintains their own tests and reports in the repository.
- **Training Needs:** None required, basic knowledge in Jasmine, Karma, NUnit is assumed.

---

# 11. Risks, Dependencies, Assumptions, and Constraints

| Risk | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| Low test coverage due to time constraints | Focus on core functionalities |
| Faulty testing environments | Early setup and tool verification |
| Changes in API structure | Close coordination between frontend and backend teams |

---

# Summary

- Focus on unit and API tests.
- Target 20–30% test coverage.
- Local testing on developer machines.
- Reports via Jasmine, Karma, NUnit, and manual verification with Swagger.
- No CI/CD integration planned.
